==========
I am a graduate student of NYU Poly, this summer I am going to join several startups. Technically, I consider myself as some kind of full-stack web developer. Python and javascript are my favorite languages.

Recently I am coding a game in node.js, and a website in Python. Android developing is the next thing I wanna learn. So I probably will code in Java during this project.

I am interesting in building something from nothing, so if you have a interesting idea, please contact me.
